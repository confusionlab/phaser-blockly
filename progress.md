Original prompt: add ability to rename proj name by clicking on title in proj page

- Added inline project-title rename UX in toolbar: click title to edit, blur/Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Started validation: file-level lint passes for modified file.
- TODO: run Playwright web-game client loop and inspect generated screenshot/state artifacts.
- Playwright skill-client run is blocked in this repo environment: missing `playwright` package (client imports it directly).
- No additional dependency changes were made for this task.
