Original prompt: add ability to rename proj name by clicking on title in proj page

- Added inline project-title rename UX in toolbar: click title to edit, blur/Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Started validation: file-level lint passes for modified file.
- TODO: run Playwright web-game client loop and inspect generated screenshot/state artifacts.
- Playwright skill-client run is blocked in this repo environment: missing `playwright` package (client imports it directly).
- No additional dependency changes were made for this task.
- Added new camera block `camera_set_follow_offset` (x/y) in Blockly toolbox + search modal.
- Wired code generation: `camera_set_follow_offset` now emits `runtime.cameraSetFollowOffset(x, y)`.
- Runtime camera follow now preserves configured lerp and applies stored follow offset when `camera follow` starts, so offset applies with follow + follow range behavior.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm lint` fails due to many pre-existing repo-wide lint errors (not introduced by this change).
- TODO: if strict lint gating is required, address existing lint baseline across unrelated files.
- Re-checked Playwright skill-client (`web_game_playwright_client.js`) after camera change: still blocked with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Investigated gravity property panel issue: per-body gravity path existed, but runtime read `scene.matter.world.engine.gravity`, which is undefined in this Phaser Matter engine shape.
- Fixed gravity source in `RuntimeEngine.applyCustomGravity` to `scene.matter.world.engine.world.gravity`, so custom gravity from object physics settings is applied again.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes after the fix.
- Playwright skill-client remains blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Updated component instance sync behavior in `updateObject`:
  - Instance-only keys are now: `x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `visible`, `rotation`.
  - Shared component keys synced across all instances now include `physics` (plus name/code/costumes/current costume/collider/sounds).
- This fixes physics properties edited on one component instance not propagating to other instances.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
