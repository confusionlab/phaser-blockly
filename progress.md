Original prompt: add ability to rename proj name by clicking on title in proj page

- Added inline project-title rename UX in toolbar: click title to edit, blur/Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Started validation: file-level lint passes for modified file.
- TODO: run Playwright web-game client loop and inspect generated screenshot/state artifacts.
- Playwright skill-client run is blocked in this repo environment: missing `playwright` package (client imports it directly).
- No additional dependency changes were made for this task.
- Added new camera block `camera_set_follow_offset` (x/y) in Blockly toolbox + search modal.
- Wired code generation: `camera_set_follow_offset` now emits `runtime.cameraSetFollowOffset(x, y)`.
- Runtime camera follow now preserves configured lerp and applies stored follow offset when `camera follow` starts, so offset applies with follow + follow range behavior.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm lint` fails due to many pre-existing repo-wide lint errors (not introduced by this change).
- TODO: if strict lint gating is required, address existing lint baseline across unrelated files.
- Re-checked Playwright skill-client (`web_game_playwright_client.js`) after camera change: still blocked with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Investigated gravity property panel issue: per-body gravity path existed, but runtime read `scene.matter.world.engine.gravity`, which is undefined in this Phaser Matter engine shape.
- Fixed gravity source in `RuntimeEngine.applyCustomGravity` to `scene.matter.world.engine.world.gravity`, so custom gravity from object physics settings is applied again.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes after the fix.
- Playwright skill-client remains blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Updated component instance sync behavior in `updateObject`:
  - Instance-only keys are now: `x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `visible`, `rotation`.
  - Shared component keys synced across all instances now include `physics` (plus name/code/costumes/current costume/collider/sounds).
- This fixes physics properties edited on one component instance not propagating to other instances.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
- Implemented touching block overhaul:
  - `ground` is now a target option in generic touching dropdowns (`sensing_touching`, `event_when_touching`).
  - Removed standalone `sensing_touching_ground` from toolbox/search UI (kept block definition + generator for old-project compatibility).
- Added new directional touching blocks with direction dropdown (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `side`):
  - Event hat: `event_when_touching_direction`
  - Boolean sensing: `sensing_touching_direction`
- Runtime updates for directional collision filtering:
  - Added `runtime.onTouchingDirection(...)` and `runtime.isTouchingDirection(...)`.
  - Added direction classification based on overlap axis + relative centers.
  - Added directional support for direct targets, `COMPONENT_ANY:*`, `MY_CLONES`, `GROUND`, and `EDGE` (for boolean checks).
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
- Playwright skill-client remains blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Fixed async-in-forever codegen/runtime bug that caused generated scripts to fail when blocks with `await` (e.g., rotate tween) were placed inside `forever`.
- `event_forever` now generates `async function(sprite)` in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/CodeGenerator.ts`, so generated `await` statements are syntactically valid.
- Runtime forever loop now supports async handlers safely in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/RuntimeEngine.ts`:
  - Forever handler type accepts `void | Promise<void>`.
  - Added per-sprite per-handler pending tracking to prevent overlapping async invocations each frame.
  - Added async error logging and pending-state cleanup.
  - Clears pending async forever state in `stopAll()` and `stopSprite()`.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Skill Playwright client run is still blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"` from `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`.
- Completed runtime/codegen bug-audit fix pass for codegen/runtime mismatch issues.
- Fixed codegen string literal safety by introducing `asJsString(...)` and using it for text/dropdown string fields (messages, scene names, target IDs, sounds, key/easing/color values) in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/CodeGenerator.ts`.
- Fixed clone-context motion/attachment targeting:
  - glide/rotate/attach/detach blocks now target `sprite.id` (current executing sprite), not original `spriteId`.
- Fixed `point towards mouse` coordinate-space mismatch:
  - generator now uses runtime world-coordinate mouse getters.
  - added `getMouseWorldX/Y()` in runtime.
- Hardened async event dispatch in runtime:
  - added centralized `invokeEventHandler(...)` with sync+async error handling.
  - key/click/touch/message/clone-click paths now use it to avoid unhandled promise rejections.
- Fixed `broadcastAndWait` semantics:
  - message queue now stores message envelopes.
  - `broadcastAndWait` resolves after all async message handlers for that broadcast settle.
- Fixed cleanup leak on delete paths:
  - `deleteSelf`/`deleteObject` now clear forever-loop activity and pending async-forever tracking maps.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Skill Playwright client still blocked in environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
