Original prompt: add ability to rename proj name by clicking on title in proj page

- Added inline project-title rename UX in toolbar: click title to edit, blur/Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Started validation: file-level lint passes for modified file.
- TODO: run Playwright web-game client loop and inspect generated screenshot/state artifacts.
- Playwright skill-client run is blocked in this repo environment: missing `playwright` package (client imports it directly).
- No additional dependency changes were made for this task.
- Added new camera block `camera_set_follow_offset` (x/y) in Blockly toolbox + search modal.
- Wired code generation: `camera_set_follow_offset` now emits `runtime.cameraSetFollowOffset(x, y)`.
- Runtime camera follow now preserves configured lerp and applies stored follow offset when `camera follow` starts, so offset applies with follow + follow range behavior.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm lint` fails due to many pre-existing repo-wide lint errors (not introduced by this change).
- TODO: if strict lint gating is required, address existing lint baseline across unrelated files.
- Re-checked Playwright skill-client (`web_game_playwright_client.js`) after camera change: still blocked with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Investigated gravity property panel issue: per-body gravity path existed, but runtime read `scene.matter.world.engine.gravity`, which is undefined in this Phaser Matter engine shape.
- Fixed gravity source in `RuntimeEngine.applyCustomGravity` to `scene.matter.world.engine.world.gravity`, so custom gravity from object physics settings is applied again.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes after the fix.
- Playwright skill-client remains blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Updated component instance sync behavior in `updateObject`:
  - Instance-only keys are now: `x`, `y`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `visible`, `rotation`.
  - Shared component keys synced across all instances now include `physics` (plus name/code/costumes/current costume/collider/sounds).
- This fixes physics properties edited on one component instance not propagating to other instances.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
- Implemented touching block overhaul:
  - `ground` is now a target option in generic touching dropdowns (`sensing_touching`, `event_when_touching`).
  - Removed standalone `sensing_touching_ground` from toolbox/search UI (kept block definition + generator for old-project compatibility).
- Added new directional touching blocks with direction dropdown (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `side`):
  - Event hat: `event_when_touching_direction`
  - Boolean sensing: `sensing_touching_direction`
- Runtime updates for directional collision filtering:
  - Added `runtime.onTouchingDirection(...)` and `runtime.isTouchingDirection(...)`.
  - Added direction classification based on overlap axis + relative centers.
  - Added directional support for direct targets, `COMPONENT_ANY:*`, `MY_CLONES`, `GROUND`, and `EDGE` (for boolean checks).
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
- Playwright skill-client remains blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Fixed async-in-forever codegen/runtime bug that caused generated scripts to fail when blocks with `await` (e.g., rotate tween) were placed inside `forever`.
- `event_forever` now generates `async function(sprite)` in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/CodeGenerator.ts`, so generated `await` statements are syntactically valid.
- Runtime forever loop now supports async handlers safely in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/RuntimeEngine.ts`:
  - Forever handler type accepts `void | Promise<void>`.
  - Added per-sprite per-handler pending tracking to prevent overlapping async invocations each frame.
  - Added async error logging and pending-state cleanup.
  - Clears pending async forever state in `stopAll()` and `stopSprite()`.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Skill Playwright client run is still blocked in this environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"` from `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`.
- Completed runtime/codegen bug-audit fix pass for codegen/runtime mismatch issues.
- Fixed codegen string literal safety by introducing `asJsString(...)` and using it for text/dropdown string fields (messages, scene names, target IDs, sounds, key/easing/color values) in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/phaser/CodeGenerator.ts`.
- Fixed clone-context motion/attachment targeting:
  - glide/rotate/attach/detach blocks now target `sprite.id` (current executing sprite), not original `spriteId`.
- Fixed `point towards mouse` coordinate-space mismatch:
  - generator now uses runtime world-coordinate mouse getters.
  - added `getMouseWorldX/Y()` in runtime.
- Hardened async event dispatch in runtime:
  - added centralized `invokeEventHandler(...)` with sync+async error handling.
  - key/click/touch/message/clone-click paths now use it to avoid unhandled promise rejections.
- Fixed `broadcastAndWait` semantics:
  - message queue now stores message envelopes.
  - `broadcastAndWait` resolves after all async message handlers for that broadcast settle.
- Fixed cleanup leak on delete paths:
  - `deleteSelf`/`deleteObject` now clear forever-loop activity and pending async-forever tracking maps.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Skill Playwright client still blocked in environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Implemented multi-selection transform editing in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/components/stage/ObjectInspector.tsx`:
  - Inspector now reads `selectedObjectIds` and resolves all selected objects in scene order.
  - Transform fields (`X`, `Y`, `W`, `H`, `Rotation`) now show `multiple` when selected objects have mixed values, otherwise show shared value.
  - Alt+drag scrubbing now applies delta edits to every selected object (relative to each object's drag-start value).
  - Typed/committed values now apply as absolute values to every selected object.
  - Scale edits now preserve per-object flip sign while changing absolute scale magnitude.
  - Visibility toggle now applies to all selected objects and shows indeterminate for mixed visibility.
  - Physics panel remains single-object-only and is hidden when multiple objects are selected.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Required skill Playwright client run attempted but blocked in this environment: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package \"playwright\"` from `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`.
- Additional validation:
  - `pnpm exec eslint src/components/stage/ObjectInspector.tsx` passes.
- Improved stage selection reliability + added marquee box-select in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/components/stage/PhaserCanvas.tsx`:
  - Stage object click selection now supports modifiers in-canvas:
    - plain click: single select
    - Shift+click: additive select
    - Cmd/Ctrl+click: toggle select
  - Selection visuals/gizmos are now synchronized from current editor store state every frame in editor scene, preventing stale hidden gizmos.
  - Added empty-stage marquee selection (left-drag on background) in editor mode:
    - plain drag: replace selection
    - Shift+drag: add to selection
    - Cmd/Ctrl+drag: toggle selection in dragged region
    - plain click on empty stage clears selection
  - Added immediate editor hit-area interactivity setup with one-frame fallback guard to reduce intermittent non-selectable objects.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - Required skill Playwright client run attempted and still blocked in environment with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"` from `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`.
- Follow-up reliability hardening in stage input:
  - Added `pointerupoutside` handling to end panning and finalize marquee selection when mouse-up happens outside the canvas.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes after the follow-up fix.
- Re-ran required skill Playwright client after pointerupoutside hardening; still blocked with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package "playwright"`.
- Implemented pixel-perfect stage single-click selection in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/components/stage/PhaserCanvas.tsx`:
  - Added top-down object picking by render order/depth, selecting the first object whose sprite pixel alpha at the click point is opaque (`getPixelAlpha`-based).
  - Transparent pixels now fall through to objects underneath (raycast-style hit behavior).
  - Removed per-object pointerdown-based selection dependency and removed the large interactive background zone used for marquee-start (which could interfere with hit routing).
  - Kept marquee multi-select, but it now starts from a global pointerdown only when no opaque object pixel was hit.
  - Added gizmo-handle hit guard so transform handle interactions don't accidentally trigger underlying-object selection.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm exec eslint src/components/stage/PhaserCanvas.tsx` runs with existing hook-dependency warnings only.
  - Required skill Playwright client run attempted; still blocked by missing `playwright` package (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
- Multi-selection interaction overhaul in `/Users/kihaahn/code/0040-pochacoding/src/components/stage/PhaserCanvas.tsx`:
  - Plain click on an already-selected object in a multi-selection now preserves the multi-selection (does not collapse), enabling immediate group drag.
  - Group drag translate implemented: dragging one selected object now translates all selected objects together and commits all moved positions on drag end.
  - Group drag binding is applied in both initial editor-scene object creation and runtime-added object creation paths.
- Multi-selection gizmo behavior:
  - Added a single combined multi-selection bounding gizmo (one bounding box + handles + rotate handle/line) for multi-selected objects.
  - Individual object gizmos are hidden while multi-selection is active.
- Screen-space persistent gizmo UI:
  - Single-object gizmo handle sizes, rotate-handle offset, and outline stroke now compensate for object scale and camera zoom to stay visually consistent on screen.
  - Multi-selection gizmo handle sizes/strokes also scale by camera zoom for consistent screen-space UI.
- Validation:
  - `pnpm build` passes.
  - `pnpm exec eslint src/components/stage/PhaserCanvas.tsx` runs with existing hook-dependency warnings only.
  - Required skill Playwright client run attempted; still blocked by missing `playwright` package (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
